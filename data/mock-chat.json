      "meaning": "You have the right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results, and never be attached to not doing your duty.",
      "guidance": "Focus on what you can control—your efforts and actions—rather than worrying about outcomes. Take one step at a time. When you let go of attachment to results, you reduce anxiety and find peace in the process itself."
